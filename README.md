## Requirements to succesfully run this app:

1. Must run APK on a physical device in order to test NFC reading/ writing
2. Hardware considerations/ requirements: Device must support NFC reading/ writing

5. Additional information:
- When adding a new contact via NFC in or out of app it won't, currently, display in the home screen but it will display a toast if added succesfully and pushed to the database.
- I will be clearing all of the user's "saved cards" so that you can easily see if they have been added or not.
