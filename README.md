# NFC Business Cards
> Tired of losing, ruining, or just having to many business cards in your wallet? Well, we're here to try and upadte the old fad that is paper business cards by using NFC chips. It kind of works just like your contacts on your phone but a bit more professional. A way to separate business and personal matters. 

## Prerequisites

You have to use this application while on a physical device, since emulators don't have the capabilities of reading/writing to NFC chips. 
You would laso need an NFC chipto read/write to.
