# MILESTONE 1

## Requirements to succesfully run this app:

1. Must run APK on a physical device in order to test NFC reading/ writing
2. Hardware considerations/ requirements: Device must support NFC reading/ writing
3. You are free to create your own account, you can leave "contact information" in the profile view empty or fill it out. It will still write the user's UID on to an NFC
Accounts you can use to sign in: 
EMAIL: hello@gmail.com  
PW: 123456
EMAIL: lyan@gmail.com
PW 123456
4. List of known bugs:
- When you sign out and hit back you are taken back to the home screen where the lsit of contacts should show
- There is no validation for user Contact information
5. Additional information:
- When adding a new contact via NFC in or out of app it won't, currently, display in the home screen but it will display a toast if added succesfully and pushed to the database.
- I will be clearing all of the user's "saved cards" so that you can easily see if they have been added or not.
