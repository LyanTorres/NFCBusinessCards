# FINAL SUBMISSION

## Requirements to succesfully run this app:

1. Must run APK on a physical device in order to test NFC reading/ writing
2. Hardware considerations/ requirements: Device must support NFC reading/ writing
3. You are free to create your own account, you can leave "contact information" in the profile view empty or fill it out. It will still write the user's UID on to an NFC

4. List of known bugs:
- Only load very specifc image urls for example: google search for an image and right clikc to open image link and use that one to display
- some videos from youtube are copyrighted so they won't play but that's not something I can fix atm
5. Additional information:
- I've monkey tested it as much as I can so if you find a way to crash it I will be mildly impressed/ very SAD :'(((
- I've left some NFC with Hoyt who said will leave them on your desk, they are named with who's info they have saved in them and an empty one so you can write to it to. You can overwrite cards without crashing but just in case.
